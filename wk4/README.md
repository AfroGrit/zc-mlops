# Deployment

NB - trying my env with *Python 3.10.4*

3 ways of deploying a model:
1. Batch
2. Webservices
3. Streaming

## Web services
### Web-services: Deploying models with Flask and Docker
### Web-services: Getting the models from the model registry (MLflow)


## Streaming
### Deploying models with Kinesis and Lambda

## Batch: 
### Preparing a scoring script
